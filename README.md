### how to POC

what will it be - 

battle agianst "AI" enemy.

Each turn a timer starts for both players to take their actions

actions are 
- activate / deactivate skills
- attack / block / dodge / ?

when the last player chooses, the actions are executed,
damage is calculated, aura is deducted for active skills,
and the battle may be over


how to achieve it - 

engine - we need to know how to calculate the effects of players' actions.
this should be broken up further... 
* what are attacks? 
* how does different nen skills
interact, and how does their rank inluence these interactions?
* can you win in any way other then "killing" (bringin enemy HP to 0?)
    - what about draining their aura?

"AI" - hard-code an enemy NenUser, have them execute a very simple strategy
like load power for 2 turns then attack



which class should we fly to Japan?
