- how active nen skills effect phyiscal skills (future - other nen skills)


deduct resources (aura, stamina, aerobic...)

actual power - given a physical battle action (name, power)
considering the modifiers and skill ranks (from nen user) what is the
power of the move


exchange - effects of opposing active skills, distance, chosen phsysical skill etc.
